1.	I have attached a little program that I have created in FORTRAN for my internship at NCI. It basically can take a file of coordinates of a region of interest of a cell, and it will perform several computations creating a “signature” for the cell. Some of the computations include the centroid, distance from the membrane to the centroid, and angles for each pixel on the membrane. All of these characteristics make up the shape of the cell, and it can be used to identify it. The program also has the capability to read two regions of interest at once and compare them. This would help researchers find cells of similar characteristics mathematically, rather than relying on the human eye.
